## Create and provide link to story map created in Mural

## Research:

   ## List Applications Researched: (links to websites / applications)
   ### Bumble.com

   ## List what you like about each site:
   ## I like that bumble provides an option for people who are looking for friends, a dating section, and a networking section.

   ## List what you do not like about each site:
   1. The swiping left or right on the profiles in the friendship section.
   2. It takes to much time to swipe through all the members and swiping feels more like everything is based on looks rather than real connections.
   3. You have to pay for almost everything on Bumble.

   ## How my application will be different:
   1. It will just be for women and no dating section.
   2. No swiping left or right on profiles.
   3. It will be free to the users.

## Create wireframes and user flow diagram for at least 4 pages including Home, About, Contact Us and one other page demonstrating the specific functionality of your capstone's purpose (add link to wireframes one wireframe for each page with a min of 4 pages)

## Create and provide link to User Flow


## Create and provide link to SWOT Analysis
## Strengths
 1. Not many companies doing a platform for women only to connect with each other
 2. A free platform
 3. Women who are already in relationships and/or don't want the possible harassment from men, would be more geared to my website.
## Weakness
 1. A major company is doing something similar
 2. A brand new company, building trust with the public can be difficult
 3. It will take time to get numerous amounts of users like Bumble
## Opportunities
 1. Smaller and more intimate may be a better option for some
 2. Better communication amongst members since it's a smaller community
 3. Can expand the business and add on events section, or forums
 4. Opportunities to make money through advertisements
## Threats
 1. Needs a great amount of money for marketing
 2. It will take time to stand out amongst established sites
 3. Can get very tech heavy while implementing new languages for the growth of the business. May need to hire more experienced web developers and a IT department down the road.
